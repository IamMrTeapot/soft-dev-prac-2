                from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.</p>

                Aesthetics, or esthetics (/ɛsˈθɛtɪks, iːs-, æs-/), is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature
                of beauty and taste, as well as the philosophy of art (its own area of philosophy that comes out of
                aesthetics). It examines subjective and sensori-emotional values, or sometimes called judgments of
                sentiment and taste.
